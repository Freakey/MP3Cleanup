# MP3Cleanup
#### Automatically sort all of your .mp3-files without creating lots of folders!

Don't you hate creating hundreds of folders just because you want your music sorted? Now you don't have to anymore! MP3Cleanup will sort all of your .mp3-files with your settings automatically.

- Easily load the files you want
- Specify your settings, which format should the file's name have, how should the folders be sorted
- Fast and easy to understand for everyone

###How to use?
1. Download the .jar-file ([Download] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/fexk0sli33astrg/MP3Cleanup.rar?dl=0))
2. Start the program from your terminal (`java -jar MP3Cleanup.jar`)
3. Click `Add` and select the music files you want to sort
4. Edit the `Folder Format` and `File Name Format` text fields
5. Click start and select a folder where the files & folders should be put in
  1. The program will probably need some extra information for some music-files, if they are not complete.
  2. If this is true, just fill in the needed information.
6. Open your selected folder and look at your easily sorted music.


###How to edit Folder Format & File Name Format
There are two settings you can specify, `Folder Format` and `File Name Format`.
Both of textfields contain placeholders, which you can use to format your file's and folder's names.

- **{TRACK}** the number of this track in the album
- **{ALBUM}** the name of the track's album
- **{ARTIST}** the name of the track's artist
- **{YEAR}** the year when the track was published

You can use these to create your own custom format for folders and files.
__If you don't want that, just leave the default values__
